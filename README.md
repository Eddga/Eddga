### Oh .. you? ... Here? Happy to see you ❤️

I still feel pretty lost in the big github space.
Feeling more comfortable every day though I guess.
I'm not a programmer. Really I'm not..

All I do is occassionally writing PowerShell scripts mostly for my work to automate some mostly Active Directory related stuff.
I taught myself that. And I guess that shows in the cleanliness and quality of the code. 🐈
But the main thing is that it works! Right? Right!! Right...? 🐈‍⬛

I really would be happy to be taught some real (PS) programming power from someone else sometime!
